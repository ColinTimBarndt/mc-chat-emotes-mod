# Chat Emotes

Chat Emotes is a server-side mod that utilizes the Chat Preview feature introduced in Minecraft 1.19 to provide the use of emotes like Emojis inspired by Discord and Twitch chat.
All emotes are configurable and require the players to have a resource pack installed, otherwise the chat will look normal.

Emotes can be defined using datapacks. For an example see [here](./fabric_mod_server/src/main/resources/data/chat_emotes/emote), more documentation will follow when this mod is stable.

Currently, the mod ships with support for all Emojis and aliases compatible with Discord. If there are any errors or Emojis are missing, please let me know.

As I am still developing this mod, there will be breaking changes in the configuration.

A forge version of this mod is planned.

## Client Mod

The client mod will add GUI elements to the chat that make picking an emoji easier.
